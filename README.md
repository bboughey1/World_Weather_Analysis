# World_Weather_Analysis

Using Google Maps and the Python Data environment via Jupyter, notebooks were created that would narrow down a list of potential cities to visit based on a customers preferences for temperature, rain, and snow using try-except logic.  A map of potential locations was then created showing all possible locations:

Four cities were picked, and driving routes between them were plotted using GoogleMap's directions API.

Finally, markers were created again using the same methodology from the complete vacation map to display information overlaying the travel points (city, country, current weather, and the name of a hotel within 5000m of the city).
